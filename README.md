ThinkE
======

ThinkE is a program that thinks. Open it in a browser (Firefox) and load some image files or turn on the camera.

ThinkE will organize the incoming images in a graph based on their similary. It will also randomly place some triggers. Each trigger is connected to a neuron in a neural network. When an image is integrated near a trigger then the corresponding neuron is stimulated. This neuron might stimulate other neurons which then stimulate even other neurons. Some randomly chosen neurons have actions attached so that when they fire, this action is executed. An action can be writing a letter ('a', 'b', ...) or changing a color value in an image.

That's how ThinkE talks. By typing and painting.
